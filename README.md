Task:

The size of the table as two integers [width, height] The objects starting position as two integers [x, y]

If the simulation succeeded: The objects final position as two integers [x, y]. If the simulation failed (the object falls off the table): [-1, -1] should be returned

Commands:

The object always has a direction (north, east, south or west). A simulation always starts with direction north. North means that if the object sits on [2, 4] and moves forward one step, the object will now stand on [2, 3]. The commands are: 0 = quit simulation and print results to stdout 1 = move forward one step 2 = move backwards one step 3 = rotate clockwise 90 degrees (eg north to east) 4 = rotate counterclockwise 90 degrees (eg west to south)

Example:

If the program gets 4,4,2,2 as input, the table is initiated to size 4 x 4 with the object in position [2, 2] with direction north. Then, commands 1,4,1,3,2,3,2,4,1,0 are read from stdin and executed. The final output would then be the end position of the object, in this case [0, 1].
